# Resource_Sharing_App
I have used android studio and firebase to create an android application which can access and share data from a real-time database.
The frontend GUI has been created using android studio and later it was configured to retrieve real-time data from a databse using firebase. firebase is also used to authenticate the uses credentials.
Hope you found this useful :)
